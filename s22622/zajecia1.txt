During classes we instaled Linux distribution - Debian.

   d) I chose format VDI(VirtualBox Disc Image) 
	Options: 
	-VDI(VirtualBox Disc Image)- format dedicated for VirtualBox (it means communication is better)

   e) "memory on a physical hard disk"- chose dynamic
	Options:
	- Dynamic allocation - memory size is enlarged dynamically (maximum is your declaration of this size)
